         <p style="font-size: 10px;"><span>NOTE : </span> Yoda, a short green pointy-eared alien who is from the ‘Star Wars’ movies.  Here is a picture of Yoda, in case you don’t know who is he. Yoda also has a very interesting way of speaking English. Yoda speaks English, but he speaks it with a different grammar than proper English. He has his own grammar rules, Yoda’s grammar is pretty easy to learn though. This App will translate it for you!</p>
